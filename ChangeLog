==========
FIX: Wrong Linux preprocessor macro.
FIX: Definitions of m_Malloc_usable_size, m_Malloc_trim.
FIX: Solaris 10 runtime error when libC not found. Note, malloc_usable_size exists in Solaris 11.

==========
FIX: Removed MSVC code.
IMPROVEMENT: Added hints to branches in functions implementations.

IMPROVEMENT: Added noexcept in CTors. It makes no sense to generate stack unwinding, in case of an exception, recursion to malloc will still occur here.

06-05-2023
==========
FIX: PVS warning in getRuntimeNchunk().

07-07-2023
==========
IMPROVEMENT: Made custom allocator API function names customizable. Now you can use memproxy with any custom allocator.
IMPROVEMENT: Remove malloc_trim() function check due to platform specific.
FIX: Typos in READMEs.

==========
IMPROVEMENT: Made CheckProgramInList instantiation idiomatic.
IMPROVEMENT: Made CheckProgramInList CTor protected.

08-06-2023
==========
IMPROVEMENT: Refactoring - removed unnesessary code.

08-11-2023
==========
IMPROVEMENT: Refactoring - functions pointers types grouped in FunctionsPtrTypes class.

==========
IMPROVEMENT: Added check libdl and set if found.

12-09-2023

==========
IMPROVEMENT: LibC macro made more cross-platform.

09-16-2024
==========
IMPROVEMENT: LibC function initialization class.
FIX: Got rid CheckProgramInList class.

09-17-2024
==========
IMPROVEMENT: A correct methodology for working with allocating dlopen() on Linux has been found and implemented.

09-18-2024
==========
IMPROVEMENT: Better build environment.

09-19-2024
==========
FIX: Reworked classes initialization.
FIX: Partial undo change at 09-16-2024.
FIX: Singletons instantiation.
IMPROVEMENT: Classes instances references.

09-20-2024
==========
IMPROVEMENT: Got rid dlopen call due to unified preload scheme for all platforms.

09-22-2024
==========
IMPROVEMENT: Complete refactoring; no more if's in wrapper functions.

09-23-2024
==========
FIX: Moved linker options to the correct automake variable.
